# Portfolio Setup Instructions

## Profile Image Setup

Your portfolio is using a placeholder SVG image located at `/public/profile.svg`. To use your actual profile photo:

1. Save your profile image as `profile.jpg` in the `/public` folder
2. Update the Hero component to use `profile.jpg` instead of `profile.svg`
3. The image should be:
   - Square aspect ratio (recommended)
   - High resolution (at least 400x400px)
   - Good lighting and professional appearance
